Thanks:
Great thanks goes out to RobertHammer for providing us the above named models etc.
Thanks to Bohemia Interactive for a great game and there continued support of it.
CTB Rhodesy & Ari for a last check for bugs & issues.

Special Thanks (Sabre):
ArdvarkDB - I would like to personally thank Ardvarkdb for taking on the modelling side of this project, as people would have seen I had been working on retextures of various models in the past to somewhat represent Australian Special Forces, however I was never quite happy with the models and other parts. I think what he achieved was more than I expected and seeing his skills improve over the course of the project has been great fun, thanks mate.

NOTE:
None of the models were made by me, MistaD. I only modified the PBO file to be suitable for DayZA3 (Zoombies).
